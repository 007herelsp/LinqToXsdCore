    - Contains all the legacy code for the original LinqToXsd project from the [codeplex archive](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=linqtoxsd). Aside from formatting changes (using ReSharper), such as splitting out all `class`es and `struct`s into their own separate files, it for the time being largely remains untouched.
